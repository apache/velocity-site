    <p>Since 1.6, there has been a lot of work: #@body()content#end, #[[literal content]]#, major namespacing changes, $newListSyntax[$i], and more. Please see the change log for details!</p>
    <p>Since 1.7-beta1, we fixed, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-785">VELOCITY-785</a>, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-766">VELOCITY-766</a>, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-760">VELOCITY-760</a>, and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-753">VELOCITY-753</a>.

      <b>Monday, 10 May 2010</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Velocity developers are very pleased to make VelocityTools 2.0 available for download. This should be useable as a drop in replacement for Tools 1.4 or Tools 2.0-beta4, with a few minor exceptions. The 2.x series of VelocityTools requires Velocity 1.6 and JDK 1.5+.</p>
    <p>Since the last beta release, there have been a variety of enhancements. Here's the notable ones:</p>
    <p>* Added a 'readOnly' config option to allow write operations on ValueParser and ParameterTool when set to false</p>
    <p>* Added a beta-quality UiDependencyTool (included in velocity-view, but not in default tools.xml)</p>
    <p>* Added an alpha-quality MarkupTool (included in generic tools, but not in default tools.xml)</p>
    <p>* Fixed (as much as possible) some significant last-iteration LoopTool problems, and added a getThis() method as a more reliable workaround in nested loops. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELTOOLS-124">VELTOOLS-124</a>.</p>
    <p>* VelocityLayoutServlet now checks request attributes for non-default layouts.</p>
    <p>* The velocity-view.tld is now valid.</p>
    <p>* VelocityView[Servlet] have improved exception and http management (particularly for ResourceNotFoundExceptions).</p>
    <p>* Miscellaneous documentation and build.xml improvements The Velocity developers are very interested in all feedback regarding Tools 2.0, especially regarding backwards compatibility with apps designed for Tools 1.4 or earlier. We aim to enable a smooth, incremental transition for developers and their applications.</p>
    <p>Downloads of Tools 2.0 are available <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/download.cgi#tools">here</a>.</p>

      <b>Monday, 10 May 2010</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Velocity developers would like to announce the release of Velocity Engine 1.6.4.</p>
    <p>This release provides two small bugfixes and one critical fix. The critical fix resolves a 100% CPU loop hang under simultaneous HashMap calls in our ClassMap implementation due to a classic bug in Sun's implementation. We now use ConcurrentHashMap when available and Hashtable otherwise. It's also important to note that the auto-init feature is now only supported with Java 1.5+.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-717">VELOCITY-717</a>, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-750">VELOCITY-750</a>, and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-718">VELOCITY-718</a>, .</p>

      <b>Friday, 16 April 2010</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Velocity developers would like to announce the release of Velocity Engine 1.7-beta1.</p>
    <p>Since 1.6, there has been a lot of work. Here's an overview:</p>
    <p>* Support macro bodies. Just call them like this: #@foo() body content #end</p>
    <p>* Can now escape single and double quotes in strings by doubling them</p>
    <p>* Added #[[this is included in the output but not parsed]]# syntax to replace #literal</p>
    <p>* All #set calls are now global by default; no more implicit local namespaces (not that there were well functioning ones before). To #set a local variable, use the new provided namespaces: $foreach, $macro, $template, $evaluate, $define and $foo (would exist inside the body of #@foo() #end). These must now be used to #set any variable "locally" like this: #set( $macro.mylocal = 'foo' ). When nested, access to parent namespaces is similarly explicit (e.g. $macro.parent). Please see the <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/changes-report.html">change log</a> for details.</p>
    <p>* Enhanced #break to function anywhere and optionally accept a namespace argument when you want to break beyond the nearest scope. (e.g. #break( $macro ))</p>
    <p>* Added bracketed index syntax: $foo[0] or #set( $foo[0] = 1 )</p>
    <p>* #stop now ends rendering/execution of a template, not parsing of a template</p>
    <p>* OSGI-ready manifests are now provided in the jars</p>
    <p>* A variety of small bugfixes, performance boosts and better exceptions/logging.</p>
    <p>* Removed very obsolete Veltag and WebMacro conversion code.</p>
    <p>For more details on these, see the <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/changes-report.html">change log</a>.</p>
    <p>Downloads of 1.7-beta1 are available <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/download.cgi#engine">here</a>. This should work as a drop-in replacement for Velocity 1.6.3 in most cases. Users of $velocityCount, $velocityHasNext and #literal should take note of their deprecations. Users of #stop and #break should be aware of significant changes to those features.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The Velocity developers would like to announce the release of Velocity Engine 1.6.3.</p>
    <p>This release provides users the ability to revert to the previous #if behavior, which did not call toString() in order to check its status. This results in inconsistent reference treatment, but offers much superior performance in cases where toString() is an expensive operation. To enable this reversion, set the "directive.if.tostring.nullcheck" property to false in your velocity.properties. This should restore performance of the #if directive to previous levels.</p>

    <p>The Velocity developers are pleased to make a fourth beta release of VelocityTools 2.0 available for download. This should be useable as a drop in replacement for Tools 1.4 or Tools 2.0-beta3, with a few minor exceptions. The 2.x series of VelocityTools requires Velocity 1.6 and JDK 1.5+.</p>
    <p>Since the last beta release, there have been a number of significant fixes and enhancements. Here's the key ones:</p>
    <p>* Tools references are no longer read-only by default</p>
    <p>* LinkTool double-encoding problem is fixed</p>
    <p>* Upgraded to depend on Engine 1.6.2</p>
    <p>* Deprecated ListTools due to irrelevance in Engine 1.6.x</p>
    <p>* ResourceTool now gives access to bundle keys</p>
    <p>* MultiViewsTool was changed into new, better IncludeTool</p>
    <p>* Added syntactical sugar to CookieTool</p>
    <p>* Multiple new methods contributed for DisplayTool</p>
    <p>* Added the WebappUberspector for natural #set of attributes in webapp scopes (e.g. #set( $request.foo = 'bar' ))</p>
    <p>* Refactored JeeConfig to be an interface The Velocity developers are very interested in all feedback regarding Tools 2.0, especially regarding backwards compatibility with apps designed for Tools 1.4 or earlier. We aim to enable a smooth, incremental transition for developers and their applications.</p>

    <p>The Velocity developers are pleased to make the second beta release of VelocityTools 2.0 available for download. Major development in VelocityTools 2.0 has completed, and the focus has been on fixing the remaining bugs and providing a clear migration path for users of VelocityTools 1.x. Significant new features in 2.0 include very flexible, composable toolbox configuration (via either java, xml, and/or properties), lazy-loading/initialization of tools, the VelocityViewTag for embedding Velocity within JSP, simplified embedding of VelocityTools in other frameworks, an assortment of new and improved tools, and much more. This should be useable as a drop in replacement for Tools 1.4, with a few minor exceptions where things already deprecated earlier in 1.x have been removed. The 2.x series of VelocityTools also requires both Velocity 1.5+ and JDK 1.5+.</p>
    <p>At this point, the new tool management and configuration facilities are extremely stable and useable. Documentation has continued to improve dramatically and is nearing completion. There are no open or known bugs in this release nor significant changes anticipated before 2.0 final is released. We are also more than happy to answer questions on the mailing lists. More information on the changes between Tools 1.x and 2.x may be found <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/velocity/VelocityTools2/Planning">here</a>.

    <p>The distribution also comes with a new "showcase" example webapp that demonstrates many of the uses of the various tools as well as allowing you to interactively play with them. Just download the binary distribution, and deploy the "showcase.war" example to your servlet container to try it out.</p>
