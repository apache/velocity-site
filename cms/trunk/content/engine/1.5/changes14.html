   This document tracks changes to Velocity for the 1.4 release and earlier.
   For more recent changes, please see:
   <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/changes.html" class="externalLink">http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/changes.html</a>
</p>


<a name="a1.4-rc1"></a><div class="section"><h3>1.4-rc1</h3>
<p>
    This section describes changes to the 1.4 branch after
    rc1. It was released as v1.4 on April 14, 2004.
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Update license to Apache Software License v2.0</li>

</div>

<a name="a1.4-dev"></a><div class="section"><h3>1.4-dev</h3>
<p>
This section describes changes to the main branch after the
1.3 release.  They were released as part of 1.4 rc1 on
Oct-9-2003.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Added support for dynamic selection of output character encoding to
VelocityServlet.  By default, the selected encoding is the value of
the output.encoding Velocity property, but can be made dynamic by
overriding the new chooseCharacterEncoding() method. (dlr)
</li>
<li>
Bill Boland pointed out that VelocityServlet's pooling of
VelocityWriter was preventing the underlying OutputStreamWriter from
being garbage collected.  This was fixed by clearing the
VelocityWriter's reference to its internal OutputStreamWriter to allow
the latter to be GC'd while VelocityWriter is pooled. (#18951)
</li>
<li>
Deprecated org.apache.velocity.runtime.Runtime in favor of the
RuntimeInstance and RuntimeSingleton classes. (dlr)
</li>

method selection work as specified in the JLS, from Attila

</li>
<li>

in foreach. (#7383,#7384) (gmj)
</li>
<li>
Remove '=' as a valid token for anything but #set() as nothing else can do
assignment.  (#7385) (gmj)
</li>
<li>
Fix problem where VM in stringlit as arg to VM NPE'd.  Whoops.  (gmj)

the more appropriately named
<code>Velocity.resourceExists(String)</code>.  (dlr)
</li>
<li>
Deprecated VelocityServlet's <code>properties</code> key in favor of
the namespace protected <code>org.apache.velocity.properties</code>
key. (dlr)
</li>
<li>
Update user guide - remove confusing (wrong) content. (gmj)
</li>
<li>
Brought all introspective-ish behavior under one umbrella interface, Uberspect,
to allow customizable, pluggable introspection. (gmj)
</li>
<li>``
Fixes for bug 7684 : make sure event handler called with real reference literal
even if a quiet reference.  Bug 7183 : fixes to win32 .bat files in examples
(gmj)
</li>
<li>
Fix for bugs 8517, 6955 : anything ...#set... was confusing the parser (gmj)
</li>
<li>
Removed deprecated use of DEFAULT_OUTPUTTER.output() in Anaka's NodeList (gmj)

  </li>
  <li>
    Major change to Parser char stream - no longer using the stock, javacc generated
    ASCII 8-bit char stream but rather a Unicode 'custom' char stream.  This solves

    Fixed the build/test.sh convenience script to use Ant. (jss)
  </li>
  <li>
    Intrspector fix using contributions from Attila Szegedi

    of developers guide for more info. (gmj)

  <li>
    Removed build.sh and build.bat scripts in favor of making people &quot;install&quot; Ant.

    <code>null</code> permissible to indicate that request is taken care of. (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for alternate encoding for templates (input sources). It is now
    controllable by two properties (input and output), and tested with UTF-8.
    UTF-8 rocks.  Why are there others?  :)  Also added testcase. (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed problem where MethodInvocationExceptions were not correctly generated for
    method exceptions in a few places.  All seems to work now. (gmj)

  <li>
    Performance improvment additions for the AST, the majority from Kent Johnson, plus
    his suggestions for Configuration and ResourceManager (gmj)

    More MethodInvocationExceptions fun : the LHS of a #set() could throw
    an Exception, and we wouldn't propogate it. (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    EventCartridge support.  See docs :) (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    Documentation : basic EventCartridge description. (gmj)

  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for the much acclaimed and dreaded #$foo, $$foo #$#$foofoo, etc bug.  (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    Added some autoconfigure support for the servlet example to hele
    users new to Servlets, and added a little README to help then find
    Tomcat and setup a webapp. (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed the .close() of the output stream in VelocityServlet
    and symmetrized VelocityWriter recycle.  (gmj)
  </li>
  <li>
     Converted from using the Velocity Configuration class (now deprecated) to
     the Jakarta Commons collections component's ExtendedProperties class.

<a name="a1.0b2"></a><div class="section"><h3>1.0b2</h3>

<p>
   Released as version 1.0 beta 2 on March 26, 2001
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Make the distribution have CRLF for all of the text files (JSS).
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed release packaging to create things in the right directory
        structure (JSS).
    </li>
    <li>
         Re-added 'include' support for Configuration. (JVZ)
    </li>
    <li>
         Fixed VMProxy bug when reference arg was null. (#1074) (gmj)
    </li>
    <li>
         Fixed nullpointer problem in cache refresh in ResourceManager
         (reported by Ilkka Priha) (gmj)
    </li>
    <li>
         VelocityServlet now respects the 'default.contentType'
         property again.  That must have fallen out during the 'request
         process' rework in VelServlet.  (reported by csterg@aias.gr) (gmj)
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed AnakiaTask and TexenTask to use the canonical
        template file path rather than the literal string specified.
        Motivated for ease of gump-tion.  Also added
        failonerror to the testcases.xml for the same reason. (gmj)
    </li>
    <li>
       Added Sam's suggestion for normalizing \n[\r] when comparing
       results to expected results in the testbed via BaseTestCase  (gmj)
    </li>
    <li>
       Qualified import statments in Generator.java.  Added tests for
       automatic boolean mapping in TexenTestCase.java. Added default
       boolean mapping to texen for properties used with  the
       contextProperties option.  Allow variants on boolean values in
       Configuration.java, and changes to relevant templates in testbed.
       Added default objects to context in TexenTask.java. (JVZ)
     </li>
     <li>
        Documentation changes to Configuration.java (DLR)
     </li>
     <li>
       Augmented the MethodInvocationException message in ASTMethod to
       make the stacktraces more useful - noted from some traffic on
       Turbine list.   (gmj)
     </li>
     <li>
         Added powered by logo. Look in
         xdocs/images/powered-by-logo.psd/.gif (JSS)
     </li>
     <li>
       Changed the internals of the Configuration class so that
       setProperty(K,V) will replace the value at K with V;
       addProperty(K,V) works the way setProperty(K,V) used
       to: if there is a value already stored at K then
       V is added to the vector. If nothing is being stored
       at K then the scalar V is simply added. setProperty(K,V)
       is basically a short form for clearProperty(K)/addProperty(K,V).
       Also added setConfiguration(C), so that an application using
       velocity could easily take a subset of the application
       configuration using C.subset(velocityProps) and set the
       whole velocity configuration at once. This is now how
       the velocity service works in Turbine. (JVZ)

       Added support to the Runtime/Velocity classes for
       addProperty(K,V). (JVZ)

        Confirmed that the build.bat works on Win98 as well as made the
        classpath that the build.bat generates equal to the one that
        build.sh generates. (JSS)
