    <section name="Production releases">
      <p>
        These releases are considered stable and suitable for production.

    <section name="Alpha/Beta releases">

        These releases are not yet production-ready but they might contain new features or bug fixes that are not yet in the 
        production release.

    <section name="Nightly builds">
      <p>
       The nightly builds are generated automatically and there is no guarantee that these archives even build or work. They
       are intended if you want to keep up-to-date with the development of a project and can not for any reason download the
       source code straight from the Subversion repository and build it yourself.
      </p>
    </section>
   
    <section name="Source code repository">
      <p>
       You can download the source code to each Apache Velocity project directly from our public subversion repository. Here
       you get logs, change histories and all the information necessary to follow the development process. If you are interested
       in the project development, please join the Apache Velocity development list.
