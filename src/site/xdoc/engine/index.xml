      <p>
        The Apache Velocity Engine is a free open-source templating
        engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Velocity permits you to use a simple yet powerful template
        language to reference objects defined in Java code.

        It is written in 100% pure Java and can be easily embedded into
        your own applications.

        The engine is the core of the
        <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">
          Apache Velocity Project
        </a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Velocity Integration">
      <p>
        The Velocity engine includes a number of predefined tasks for
        easy integration into
        <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Integration into web applications and frameworks is available
        through the
